# Budgeter

Based on this quote: [It’s like that person saying to you, “Give me your paycheques. I will make sure all of your bills are paid on time, you have enough savings for emergencies, irregular expenses and your goals, and will give you your spending money. Spend it all if you wish, but don’t come back until your next payday. That’s when I’ll give you more.”](https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/blog/organize-bank-accounts-in-3-steps-with-fixed-savings-and-variable-expenses.html)
